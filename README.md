 In this challenge, you are tasked with cr******ing a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company.
 You will give a set of financial data called [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv).
 The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`. 
 (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)

* Your task is to cr******e a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The net ******** amount ********rofit/Losses" over the entire period
* Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes
* The gr******est increase in profits (dat******** amount********r the entire period
* The gr******est decrease in losses (dat******** amount********r the entire period
* As an example, your analysis should look similar to the one below:
